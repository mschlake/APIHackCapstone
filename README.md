# Summary 
The Hero vs. Villian app allows the user to search and display information on their favorite Superheroes or Villians from both comic universes (DC/Marvel). The app pulls data from the SuperHero API and displays powerstats, images, appearance, and information about the character the user searches for. User can then choose to view Super Hero/Villian teams that the character is a part of.
